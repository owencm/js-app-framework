A small JS web app framework
============

This is the product of an evening spent writing a simple framework which supports:

- Models (like classes for data types) and sets of them
- Persistence to localstorage by default
- Rendering cards based on the models using HTML5 templates

The result is a small web app for 'goal' setting, written with this framework. The library and app are inline.
